*Vim*

** Setup

*** Requirements

- [[https://www.iterm2.com/index.html][iTerm 2]]
- [[https://emacsformacosx.com/][Emacs]]

** Keyboard

- Switch =<Control>= and =<Caps Lock>= keys for easier keyboard ergonomics with Vim.

** Emacs

I mainly use this instead of my Neovim/Tmux/iTerm setup. Why? Emacs is more comprehensive as I use =org-mode= extensively. Coq support via Proof General is also a huge plus.

** Vim/Tmux/iTerm

*Neovim*

Like Vim but with better asynchronous support and default configurations.

*Tmux*

Terminal multiplexer. See =tmux.conf= for full configuration details. Prefix is =<C-a>=.
