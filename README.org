** Setup

*** Requirements

- iTerm
- Emacs

** Keyboard

- Switch `<Control>` and `<Caps Lock>` keys for easier keyboard ergonomics with Vim.

** Emacs

I mainly use this instead of my Vim/Tmux/iTerm setup.use with Coq and Proof General

** Vim/Tmux/iTerm

- Tmux

Terminal multiplexer. See =tmux.conf= for full configuration details. Prefix is `<Control>` + `<a>`.

- Neovim

Like Vim but with better asynchronous support and default configurations.
