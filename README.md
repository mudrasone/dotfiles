**An opinionated OSX/Ubuntu terminal-based software development toolset and workflow**

### Setup

*Requirements*

* Vagrant

To get started on OSX, simply run:

```
vagrant up
```

If you are currently running Ubuntu or a similar Debian distribution, run:

```
sudo curl https://civiclabsconsulting.github.io/dotfiles/install | sh
```

## Keyboard

* Switch `<Control>` and `<Caps Lock>` keys for easier keyboard ergonomics with Vim.

## Terminal

iTerm is great, a bit more robust than OSX's default terminal, Terminal.app. iTerm 3.0 supports ligatures which can be useful.

## Tmux

Terminal multiplexer. See `tmux.conf` for full configuration details.

* Prefix is `<Control>` + `<a>`
