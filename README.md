**Vim/Tmux/iTerm**

## Setup

**Requirements**

* [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/index.html)
* [Emacs](https://emacsformacosx.com/)

**Keyboard**

* Switch `<Control>` and `<Caps Lock>` keys for easier keyboard ergonomics with Vim.

## Emacs

I mainly use this instead of my Neovim/Tmux/iTerm setup. Why? Emacs is more comprehensive as I use `org-mode` extensively. Coq support via Proof General is also a huge plus.

## Vim/Tmux/iTerm

### Neovim

Like Vim but with better asynchronous support and default configurations.

### Tmux

Terminal multiplexer. See `tmux.conf` for full configuration details. Prefix is `<C-a>`.

## FAQ

1. Why isn't this file an org file?

Working on it.
